Introduction

The aim of this excercise is to create a multiple linear regression model that will explain the "excess returns" of a stock,
taking into account the 3 factor fama-french model (Market Risk, Size Premium and Value Premium) 

In the first part of the excercise I calculate daily returns for up to 5 stocks in the data set,
and based on a simple metric, I will choose one stock for further analysis.

In the second part of the excercise I load and prepare the `fama_french_daily.csv` data,
merge the two dataframes, and perform multiple regression on the chosen stock
using the Fama-French 3 Factors model.
